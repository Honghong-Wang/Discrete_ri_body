# Kinetostatics_for_CACM
A kinetostatics modeling framework for contact-aided compliant mechanism (CACM). The article is available on https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531684, named "A Novel Contact-aided Continuum Robotic System: Design, Modeling, and Validation".
In this code file, the friction model is established based on the Coulomb friction theory. You can get the bending angle result, and the plot code is omitted.
The parameters such as "sec", "seg", "F_Sensor", etc. in "Main" file can be changed according to the manipulator configuration.
This general modeling framework can be used for multi-section twin-pivot design continuum manipulator and other similar manipulators.
